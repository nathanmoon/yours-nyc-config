# @yours/nyc-config

Handy default configuration for instrumenting @Yoursco projects
with test coverage using [nyc](https://github.com/istanbuljs/nyc).

First install the dependencies:

`yarn add --dev @yoursco/nyc-config`

Then write a `.nycrc.json` that looks something like this:

```json
{
  "extends": "@yoursco/nyc-config"
}
```
